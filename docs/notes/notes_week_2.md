### Discussed items:
- Code of Conduct

- Template project 
- Coding assignments of this week 


##### Code of Conduct:
The bullet points were divided among the members. We all agreed to write our own part on Overleaf. The link to the shared document was on the agenda already, but I will also add it here: https://www.overleaf.com/8411524544rybtxffgtxtq#2e46e0 

The division of the tasks:
- Minh: Shared team values, Assignment description
- Kiarash: Target or ambition level, Planning
- Jakub: Behavior
- Rares: Commitment, Decision making
- Bas: Dealing with conflicts, Consequences
- Jochem: Communication, Outside collaboration

We also agreed to focus a bit more on the coding assignment of this week, but we'll try to do the code of conduct before Tuesday (or at least start with it!).

##### Roles for future meetings 
We assigned the chairs and the minute takers for all the remaining meetings. Minh made a table in the folder docs/agendas. The file is called meeting_roles.md.

##### Template project 
As Jochem proposed, it's good to watch the video "Self Study: working with the template project" on Brightspace. That should make everything clear about the template project.

##### Coding assignments of this week 
We decided to start with the user interface part of the application. We chose one page per person. The pages can be found on the Brightspace page of OOPP: Table of Contents -> Assignments -> Product Assignments -> Project Backlog: Splitty. The pictures of the pages we have to make are on the last pages of the file. 

Division of the pages:
- Minh: Overview
- Kiarash: Start screen
- Jakub: Add expense
- Rares: Contact details
- Bas: Open debts
- Jochem: Invitation

For more information, read the project backlog file (mentioned above) and the studiegids: https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=64438 
Pay special attention to the Individual Knock-Out Elements!

Take a look into SceneBuilder editor and Java FX libraries for doing the coding. These will probably be necessary.

Also Important: do NOT add special effects or design elements to your pages! We need to have uniform pages at the end, so just keep it simple. We can dicuss the design extensively in future meetings. 

## To do:
Here I mention very shortly what we must do this week:
- Write your part of Code of Conduct (at least start)
- Watch self study video of template project on Brightspace
- Do the coding of the application page assigned to you: don't forget you need at least 100 lines of Java code, 3 commits and one merge request. Also read the manual and the studiegids for more things we have to do.
