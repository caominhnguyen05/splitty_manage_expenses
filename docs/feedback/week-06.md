# Meeting

Available marks: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Kiarash was chair and Rares was minute taker


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda was provided to the repository on time and had a clear list of talking points with reasonable time estimates. In the future, some of the points could be expanded even more, e.g. for "Discussing how to handle the calculation parts related to payments and debts" some subpoints with specific questions that need to be discussed could be included. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes were clearly and nicely intertwined with the agenda to summarise all the main points discussed. The main agreements were all mentioned and a nice table was used to summarise who is responsible for connecting which screen to the backend. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Kiarash ensured that all agenda topics were covered. He also did a great job with checking at the beginning which other topics should be included in the agenda and then keeping those in mind and integrating them throughout. It was also a good idea to summarise the assigned tasks again at the end.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You lead the meetings completely independently and manage to involve everyone in the discussion throughout. The atmosphere is constructive and everyone contributes ideas and suggestions throughout the meeting. I like seeing that you ask questions and discuss different implementations with one another in a very collaborative manner. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You presented your application and it is shippable, since all presented changes are displayed in main. You are almost done with the basic requirements and seem to have made quite some progress with the Detailed Expenses and Email Notifications as well. I also like that you have a very clear overview of which bugs are currently in the code and which tasks you still need to complete. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You had a clear discussion at the beginning of the meeting where you discussed the tasks completed from last week. It seems like everyone managed to finish their tasks. Make sure to include these sprint reviews, as well as the sprint planning in your meeting notes as well.
