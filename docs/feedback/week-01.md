# Week 1: Get to know each other

## Formative Assessment

#### 1) Self-organization

Excellent

After an initial round of introductions and some nudging from my side about starting to discuss the code of conduct, there was a good discussion amongst the group without any input from me. I also really liked that you encouraged and followed up with team members that were less involved in the discussion to make sure that everyone can share their ideas!

#### 2) Suggested Topics

Good

I still provided input for the introductory round and suggesting that you discuss the code of conduct, but from then onwards you covered all the suggested topics by yourself. From next week onwards you will have the agenda that you set up yourselved, which will give you a clearer overview of the topics you want to discuss in these meetings. You will learn more about the agenda and the roles of the chair and minute taker in the teamwork lecture.
