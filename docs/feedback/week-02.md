# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The chair and minute taker were decided in advance.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda was uploaded to the repo in advance and follows the template provided on Brightspace. It was also very clear with specific subpoints and lengths of time provided. The only section that could be expanded upon was the 'Template Project' section. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Minh came well prepared and went through the agenda well. At some points throughout he needed to be reminded to stick to the agenda, but overall Minh ensured that all the topics were covered appropriately. Minh also did a good job at improvising and including the new topic of the task distribution for this week into the discussion. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The atmosphere in the group was nice and everyone was involved with the discussion. Every team member made suggestions and comments at some point thorughout the meeting. I also thought it was great to see that whenever a decision was made, someone double checked that everyone was happy with the decision.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The shippable product is as of yet insufficient, since there is no product yet. However, this is completely normal for the second week. The template project was discussed and it was great to see that you are planning to prepare the frontend screens for next week. Remember to demonstrate what the current state of your project is for every meeting from next week onwards.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The task distributions that you have discussed this week seem very fairly distributed. You always made sure that everyone has approximately the same amount of work to do, and overall you paid attention to making the goals actionable and clear by setting specific deadlines.
