# Meeting

Available marks: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Jakub was chair and Jochem was minute taker

#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was provided a day in advance on the repository and includes extensive talking points. I also like that for the talking points there are always subpoints providing further information or clarification, e.g. suggested tasks for this week under the 'Decide the progress for next week' section.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The minutes were provided on the repository and have been included in the agenda file. The notes are clear and contain all the specific agreements that were made, includign clear summaries of the action points per person throughout. My main suggestion for improvement would be the formatting: since everything is written in bold and interspersed with the original agenda, it is difficult to see the most important points right away. Instead, I would suggest only putting the most important points (the action items) in bold so that anyone looking for them can find them immediately. 


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Jakub covered all the topics in the agenda meticulously and ensured that the topics were covered for an appropriate amount of time. As mentioned in the agenda section already, I thought it was a good idea to prepare some suggestions already for the tasks that could be relevant for this week, since these sorts of preparations help move the meeting along. Further things that I thought were really well done were summarising the main action points throughout and moving the discussion on when it got stuck on certain points for too long. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The meetings are always very equal in terms of contributions from every team member. It is also great to see how you handle differing opinions/understanding within the team, e.g. about the N-1 transfers for the payment, by discussing it with the entire team. Also lovely to hear that you are planning a team bonding activity, I think that's a great idea!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: You are still on a good track with the implementation of the project. There has been more progress on the backend and some nice additions to the frontend screens. For next week, you could also demonstrate endpoints you have created that are not connected to the front end screens yet by showing me some Postman requests. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Everyone completed their goals from last week, which shows that you are planning tasks realistically and manage to follow through with the tasks that were planned. It seems like everyone was involved in making some backend changes this week and the work is distributed equally throughout the team. For this week you also planned concrete tasks for everyone that seemed to be equally distributed. To get an excellent in this category, you can start the meetings off with a clearer summary where everyone mentions again what they worked on in the past week.
