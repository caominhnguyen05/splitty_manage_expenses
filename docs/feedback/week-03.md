# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Rares was the chair and Bas was the minute taker. 

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda was provided on the repository before the meeting, and it contained a good range of talking topics. I also like that (like last week) there are links to the documents that you are discussing so that everyone can easily follow. 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes have been added to the repository and they include a clear summary of everything that was discussed last week. I also like that it contains clear revision of tasks per person and that there is the To Do section at the end that summarises the main to dos for the week. 

#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Rares went through the agenda with diligence, ensuring that every topic was covered. I also like the use of the screen we have in the project room to make sure that everyone knows what is being talked about. I think some of the time estimations were slightly off, e.g. discussing the Code of Conduct took less time than expected. However, overall the time estimates were approximately correct. 

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The team leads the meeting completely independently and everyone in the team is actively involved in the discussion. This was especially apparent in the discussion about the database structure, where everyone was able to contribute ideas and ask questions and you worked together very well to think the database design through. Great job!

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You managed to create all screens presented in the backlog and add some basic (client-side) functionality to these as well. All of these changes, aside from the 'Invitation' screen, have been merged to main. I think you are on the right track after this first week of coding!

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: It seems like everyone met their goals this week, and the work that has been done so far was distributed fairly, with one person doing one screen each. It is great to see that you set internal deadlines for tasks, e.g. for the Code of Conduct, since this will ensure that everyone is on the same page throughout the project. I also love the idea of adding videos to the merge requests so that everyone knows exactly what the merge request accomplishes. Next week, you could reflect on whether it was reasonable to complete the goals that you set for yourself, or whether you should adjust how much work you plan for the following week.
