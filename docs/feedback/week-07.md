# Meeting

Available Marks: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Bas was chair and Minh was minute taker


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda covers a range of important topics and is clearly organised with exact time estimates. You also make good use of subpoints to further clarify the individual agenda items. However, some of these subpoints could be even more clearly formulated, e.g. the "New Design by Minh?" - is this something that Minh is proposing or something that is potentially planned for next week?


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes are nicely integrated into the agenda and the main conclusions and to dos per person are clearly highlighted. For future weeks, a bit more info and depth could be added to the notes: for example, one of Rares' tasks is "issue solving" - what exactly does this entail?


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Bas had a great overview of the agenda and ensured that all topics were discussed. It was also great that Bas encouraged Minh to make a quick summary of the main action items at the end of the meeting.  Well done!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: There was a good atmosphere in the meeting and everyone contributed nicely. One comment that I have is that there were some sub-conversations between individual members - try to avoid this and talk to the full team instead. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: There is a potentially shippable project with a wide range of functionality implemented. It seems like you have a few bugs that you are aware of, but at least during the demo none of the bugs were a problem - I would just recommend that you create some sort of overview of the bugs you are aware of and try to tackle as many as possible. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Everyone completed their tasks for the week and you have made some good progress. Keep up the good work!
