# Meeting

Available Marks: Insufficient/Sufficient/Good/Very Good/Excellent


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Jochem was chair and Jakub was minute taker


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda was clear and covered a good range of topics, although I think that the time assignment was a bit off sometimes. For example, only 3 minutes were scheduled for reviewing the assignment feedback. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes are extensive and very clear. Well done!


#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: Jochem was very adaptable throughout the meeting, so for example he managed to nicely integrate the assignment feedback into the meeting and summarised the meeting for Minh when he came late. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: As always, you manage to lead the meeting completely independently. The discussion also involved all team members and there is a constructive atmosphere. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The application is shippable and in a polished state as well. All basic requirements are implemented and a wide range of functionality in the extensions is already implemented. You also have a clear overview of what needs to be done within the extensions that are not completely ready yet, so I think you are making great progress. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Not everyone met their goal this week, but the people that were not able to meet their goal had still made good progress and had a clear reason for why they were unable to complete everything. I also think you are doing a great job at clearly assigning tasks and having an organised discussion at the beginning of the meeting.
